https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-04

## Intuition
- have a fast and slow pointer
- whenever we reach a 0, reset the current sum, otherwise keep adding it
- replace the value at the slow pointer with the current sum then increment

## Approach

## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(1)$
