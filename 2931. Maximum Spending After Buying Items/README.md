# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-spending-after-buying-items/

## Intuition
since our goal is to maximize the buying price, the question is worded in a way that we can just be greedy and sort all the items and start by picking the cheapest ones and working our way up

## Approach
- make new array with all items
- sort it
- get the total

## Time Complexity
$O(n*m + nlogn)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n*m)$
