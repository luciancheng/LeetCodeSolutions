# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/

## Intuition
- use unionfind data structures
- if the parents of two nodes are the same, that means they are already apart of the same unioned group, meaning that the edge we are on is redunant

## Approach


## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n)$
