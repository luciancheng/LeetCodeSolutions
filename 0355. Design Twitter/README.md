# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/

## Intuition
- use set to store followers for a user since we can add, remove and check in constant time

## Approach
- for getting enws feed, just start at the back and iterate through, could be more efficient if we used a heap to get 10logk time

## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n)$
