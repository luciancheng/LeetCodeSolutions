# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/

## Intuition
- only zeroes ruin the subarray
- negatives could still have a postive impact on making largest if we encounter 2, but if we only have 1 negative, we would want to check the subarray from both the left and right side of it
- can have 2 for loops, they iterate in different directions

## Approach


## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(1)$
