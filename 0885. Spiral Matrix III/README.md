# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iii/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-08

## Intuition
- have borders which grow which will be the limits that we traverse for the spiral algortihm
- cap the borders at -1 to the 1 + the col or the row. when the current coordinate is outside the grid, then just keep traversing but do not count those indices until we enter back into the grid

## Approach


## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n)$
