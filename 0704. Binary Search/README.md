# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

## Intuition
create left and right pointers. get the middle value of the pointers. if the value at the middle index is less than the target, then we need to be seraching in the upper half of the array, otherwise, we need to be searching in the bottom half.

## Approach
- just make a binary search algorithm

## Time Complexity
$O(logn)$

## Space Complexity
$O(1)$
