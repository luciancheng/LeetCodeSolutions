# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/

## Intuition
Create a custom sorting function using a hashmap containing important numbers from arr2 and map then to its index and sort based on that. if the number is not in num2, just int max to push it to the end, if both are not in arr2 then just sort based on their actual value

## Approach
- custom sort function

## Time Complexity
$O(logn)$

## Space Complexity
$O(1)$
