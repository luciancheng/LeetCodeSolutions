# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/

## Intuition
- inorder traversal gives us BST in sorted order
- if we can just find the kth element in that sorted order, that is the k smallest element

## Approach
- make dfs algorithm, adding to array in order traversal

## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n)$
