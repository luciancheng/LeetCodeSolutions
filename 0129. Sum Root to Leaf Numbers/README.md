## Intuition
- want a way to keep track of our current number, long a path
- have that as a parameter to the function, each time we encounter a new number, do cur * 10 + val to add the new digit
- have global variable to keep track of the current sum

## Approach

## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n)$
