# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iv/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-09

## Intuition
- iterate through until we reach the end of the linked list
- 2d array shouild be initialized with -1
- have border limits on the top, bottom, left and right of the matrix that we bring in as the current index hits that spot so we closed it in

## Approach

## Time Complexity
$O(m*n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(m*n)$
