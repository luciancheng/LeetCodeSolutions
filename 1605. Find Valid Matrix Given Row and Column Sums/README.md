https://leetcode.com/problems/find-valid-matrix-given-row-and-column-sums/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-20

## Intuition
- be greedy
- can take the minimum of the row and col sums for far, and use that as the squares value. then subtract that value from the row and col
- kepe this process going, this will always get an answer

## Approach

## Time Complexity
$O(m*n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(m*n)$
