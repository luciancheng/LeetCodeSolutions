# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/

## Intuition
- to figure out which subtree to traverse, we just need to check the val against the nodes val, if its greater, recursively call to right else go left

## Approach
- set up recursive functiont o determine where node needs to go

## Time Complexity
$O(n)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n)$
