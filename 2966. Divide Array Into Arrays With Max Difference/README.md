# Solution Walk Through
https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-arrays-with-max-difference/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-14

## Intuition
- since we need subarray of size 3, if its not perfectly divisible by 3, we have a problem.
- since we want to know the difference between the smallest and largest element in a subarray we can just sort it and get the min and max of each sub array and check it agianst k

## Approach


## Time Complexity
$O(nlogn)$

## Space Complexity
$O(n)$
